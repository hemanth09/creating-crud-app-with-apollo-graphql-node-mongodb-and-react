# Creating a simple CRUD app with NodeJS, MongoDB, GraphQL, React and Apollo

# Description

A simple Apollo + GraphQL + NodeJs + Express + MongoDB + React CRUD

This repository shows a complete example of a CRUD application based on NodeJs, React with Graphql API.
This is a FullStack app to cover all stages of GraphQL at server and client side.

DEMO - ![](demo.gif)

### Set Up
Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemanth09/creating-crud-app-with-apollo-graphql-node-mongodb-and-react.git
cd creating-crud-app-with-apollo-graphql-node-mongodb-and-react
npm/yarn install
```

Create a cluster in MongoDB Atlas and add connection string in your server.js file where prompting MONGO_URI = ''
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- [Create a cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/)

### Running the Application

Run it using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
And in browser App will running on http://localhost:4000/
And Graphql server will be running on http://localhost:4000/graphql

#### Server directory
[http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)

**server.js** - This is the main file for running the server of backend. This file contains all the required modules, establish the mongoose connection and GraphQL connection.

**models** - This folder contains mongoose **album** and **song** schema model that represents set of information's for album and song records in database.

**schema** - And Finally this schema folder contains the most of the GraphQL logic. The schema/schema.js takes all the types and mutations
    - **GraphQL Types** : We need to design GraphQL user schema to specify the types for API using GraphQL schema language. Inside we got **album_type.js** and **song_type.js** of types that define user schema.
    - **GraphQL Queries** : Inside schema/root_query_type.js file write a very simple GraphQl query and mongoose query used inside to retrieve albums/songs list of data from mongodb database.
    - **GraphQL Mutation**: Inside **mutations.js** file we create 4 methods addAlbum, addSong, likeSong and deleteAlbum. add methods creates new album/songs, like method updates the number of likes, delete method deletes the record.

#### Client directory
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

**index.js** - Here we create a Apollo Client to establish connection to our GraphQL Server API, And Routing with React
**queries** - Here we define Apollo GraphQL queries by using `graphql-tag`. Graphql Tag is a JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL queries.
**components** - Component folder consist of files responsible for creating albums/songs, likes and deleting the album. we used `react-apollo` to connect our components and pass our **mutations** and **queries** defined using `graphql-tag`
